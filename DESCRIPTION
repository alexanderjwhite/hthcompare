Title: Variable Selection with Mixture of Models
Date: 2021-05-16
Version: 0.1-0
Description: Two methods are implemented to cluster data with finite mixture
    regression models. Those procedures deal with high-dimensional covariates and
    responses through a variable selection procedure based on the Lasso estimator.
    A low-rank constraint could be added, computed for the Lasso-Rank procedure.
    A collection of models is constructed, varying the level of sparsity and the
    number of clusters, and a model is selected using a model selection criterion
    (slope heuristic, BIC or AIC). Details of the procedure are provided in
    "Model-based clustering for high-dimensional data. Application to functional data"
